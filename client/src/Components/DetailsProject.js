              Human Appeal is a Manchester-based humanitarian NGO that has been
              in existence for over 25 years and has strong links with the
              Muslim community. The organisation's aim was to revitalise their
              brand in a way that would allow them to broaden their humanitarian
              work and appeal to more secular audiences, without alienating
              their historical supporter base.

              Our direction with Muslim Aid was to create a effective, current
              and non-clich√©d approach while still strongly linking to Islamic
              tenets. For example, publications or ads to be featured in mosques
              could not feature faces, so a creative approach would be needed
              such as cropping images or enhancing the typography of designs
              whilst still retaining it as part of an integrated campaign.
